# Maze project

## Background Context
The goal of this project is to create a game in 3D using raycasting!

You don’t have to do the tasks in order, except for the first one (obviously), or if a task depends on a previous one.

You have a link to a very good and very long tutorial about raycasting in the Tips and links section below, so read it very carefully, and practice!

Please have a lot of fun doing this project!

## Requirements

### General
- All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, using gcc (Ubuntu 4.8.4-2ubuntu1~14.04) 4.8.4.
- We will use the gcc flags -Wall -Werror -Wextra and -pedantic.
- All your functions must be commented.
